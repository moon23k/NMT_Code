## NMT Code
&nbsp; **Code Translation** refers to the task of translating a user's natural language requests into the corresponding programming language. 
In this repo, we aim to compare the performance of three different modeling approaches for Code Translation. 
We will assess the strengths and limitations of each modeling method, shedding light on the quality and efficiency of code translation. 
Our goal is to gain insights into which model is most effective in the field of code translation.
